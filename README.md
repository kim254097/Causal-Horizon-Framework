# Causal–Horizon Framework

This repository collects a small set of **conceptual, non-technical papers** exploring a horizon-centered perspective in cosmology and gravitational physics. The common theme is the primacy of **causal structure, horizon-defined domains, and boundary-associated entropy** over purely volumetric descriptions of spacetime.

No new dynamical models, equations, or observational claims are introduced. The works are intended as **conceptual scaffolding** rather than completed theories.

## Positioning

**`positioning/On_the_Scope_and_Intent_of_Horizon_Centered_Approaches.pdf`**

A short positioning note clarifying the **scope, intent, and evaluative criteria** of the project as a whole.  
This document is intended as the **primary entry point for external readers and arXiv submissions**, and should be read before the other papers.

It specifies:
- what the program does and does not claim,
- how it relates to existing approaches,
- and how it should be evaluated.

## Structure

The repository is organized hierarchically, reflecting different conceptual levels of the program:

### Core

**`core/A_Causal–Horizon_Perspective_on_the_Early_Universe.pdf`**

The central framework.  
It presents a horizon-centered interpretation of early-universe cosmology, treating the observable universe as a causally bounded region defined by a primordial horizon. Other documents depend conceptually on this paper but do not modify it.

### Ontology

**`ontology/Ontology_Of_Causally_Self-consistent_Regions.pdf`**

An ontological exploration compatible with the core framework.  
It introduces *causally self-consistent regions* as a minimal ontology derived from causal accessibility and horizon structure. No new dynamics are proposed.

### Scaffold

**`scaffold/Causal_Horizons_As_A_Conceptual_Scaffold_In_Gravitational_And_Cosmological_Physics.pdf`**

A contextual paper identifying shared structural principles across horizon thermodynamics, holography, cosmological horizons, and causal-structure–based approaches.  
It serves as a conceptual bridge, not a unification.

## Scope

All papers in this repository are:

- conceptual and non-technical,
- compatible with established phenomenology,
- agnostic regarding microscopic mechanisms,
- explicitly open-ended.

Open problems are intentionally left unresolved to define directions for future formal work.
